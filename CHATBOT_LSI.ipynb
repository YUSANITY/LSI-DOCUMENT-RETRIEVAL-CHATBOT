Relevant factors include:-the role that each parent has played in the child? s life-the stability that each parent can offer the child-whether the child? s existing care arrangements can be left as they are-the child? s age: care and control of a very young child will normally lie with the mother-whether there are siblings: the Court tries if possible not to separate siblings-the child? s wishes, if he or she is old enough to express an independent opinion-the parent? s wishes, which comes second to the welfare of the child\n",
